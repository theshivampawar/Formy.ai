# How to Use the Neon Database

## Step 1: Accessing the Neon Platform

If you cannot access the Neon platform due to location restrictions, you will need to use a VPN to change your location.

### Recommended VPN

I recommend using **Windscribe**. Follow the instructions below to set it up:

- Visit the Windscribe website: [Windscribe](https://windscribe.com/)
- Download the Windscribe application for your system.
- Alternatively, you can use the Windscribe Google Chrome extension.

## Step 2: Connecting to the VPN

1. **Install Windscribe**: Follow the installation prompts to install Windscribe on your device.
2. **Open Windscribe**: Launch the application or Chrome extension.
3. **Select a Location**: Choose a location that allows access to the Neon platform.
4. **Connect**: Click the connect button to establish a VPN connection.

## Step 3: Access the Neon Database

Once you are connected to the VPN, you should be able to access the Neon database without any restrictions.

### Troubleshooting

If you still experience issues accessing the Neon platform, try the following:

- Disconnect and reconnect to the VPN.
- Try different locations within the VPN application.
- Ensure your VPN is functioning correctly and not blocked by any firewall.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully access and use the Neon database.
